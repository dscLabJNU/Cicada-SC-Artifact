### Reproducing the Motivating Experiments

After applying the necessary modifications to `PyTorch/Vision` (as described above):

1. **Run Model Loading Script**  
   Execute the following command to load local models:  
   ```bash
   python3 load_local_models.py
   ```

2. **Analyze Model Loading**  
   After the models are loaded, run the analysis script:  
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_model_loading.py
   ```

3. **View Output**  
   The resulting visualizations and analysis will be saved in the `./images` directory.
